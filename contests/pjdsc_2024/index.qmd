# Philippine Junior Data Science Challenge 2024
![](Team Photo.jpg)

### Overview
My team developed *Padyak*, aimed at assisting local government units (LGUs) to understand the street-specific components affecting their city’s active transport experience and compare these between areas, across different commuters’ sensitivities to discomfort.

### Key Features
We applied *Padyak* to Mandaluyong City and produced three results: walkability and bikeability scores for discrete streets; discomfort vs. distance curves to compare areas within the city; and a customization tool where the relative importances of walkability and bikeability components can be adjusted by an LGU in the future, based on results from real mobility surveys, to generate new scores.

### Methodology
- Data Collection and Cleaning
    - Cleaned OpenStreetMap street network data
    - EDSA road traffic accident data
    - Used image segmentation to process ~9,000 images of Mandaluyong City
- Estimated a discomfort score based on:
    - Level of pedestrian/cyclist access
    - Presence of sidewalks crossings, car parking, and bike lanes
    - Other physical characteristics affecting sense of security, traffic safety, convenience, attractiveness of route (greenery), accident risk
- Clustering and ranking of streets
    - Using K-Means, we ranked the bikeability and walkability clusters based on papers such as [Arellana et. al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2020.07.010) (2020) and [Boongaling et. al](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10441-2) (2022) respectively.
    - Used XGBoost for determining what weights to use (Gain score)
    - Applied a SHAP explainer for interpretation
- Compute Discomfort-vs-Distance Curves: The goal is to compare areas (barangays or cities) in an interpretable and inclusive way for different types of commuters. This approach is based on [Reggiani et. al](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11116-021-10198-0) (2021)
- Web Application Development: We then created a Streamlit web application to showcase the features and how an application can be built for LGUs that utilizes Padyak's methodology.

### About the Contest

Hosted by the UP Data Science Society, PJDSC is an annual, nationwide data science competition for senior high school and undergraduate students. For this year, participants were challenged to develop data science projects that address issues in urban mobility.
