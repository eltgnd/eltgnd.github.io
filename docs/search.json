    "text": "Synergy 2024: Software Solutions\n\n\nOverview\nWith the task of developing a carbon footprint calculator application, my team developed eSUKAT, a mobile application designed to empower Filipinos to measure and manage their carbon footprint with an emphasis on sustainable user retention.\nWinning first place, we implemented features such as machine learning, optical character recognition (OCR), and GPS-based location tracking, with the goal of semi-automatically tracking users’ three main consumption activities: food, electricity, and transportation. eSUKAT complements this by gamification features, personal analysis, and community-based tracking to inspire sustainable living and foster a sense of community.\n\n\nKey Features\n\neSukat\n\n\nThe app focuses on tracking users’ three main consumption activities.\nFood. Users can manually input their consumption or choose to upload images of their food. The app will automatically detect the type of food and packaging using image recognition and machine learning.\nElectricity. Users can manually input their consumption or choose to upload images of their electricity bills. The app will use OCR to autofill the relevant data, which users can edit if necessary.\nTransportation. Users’ location, once given permission, will be tracked by the app to compute carbon emissions based on the distance traveled and the mode of transport. The app guesses the user’s mode of transportation with easy manual confirmation.\n\n\neNurture\n\n\nTo encourage user retention, users nurture their own virtual companion which are endemic Philippine species (e.g. Tarsier, Philippine Eagle, Tamaraw) Endemic Animals of Philippines\nUsers can earn points through actions that reduce carbon footprint, such as sustainable food choices, which can be spent on their companions. Users can share their companions on social media platforms.\nUsers can do exciting weekly and monthly challenges that offer additional opportunities to earn points and enhance sustainability efforts.\n\n\neTrack\n\n\nPersonal Dashboard. The app offers a detailed summary of the user’s carbon footprint over time, enabling continuous improvement.\nUsers’ carbon footprint data is also converted into tangible impacts (e.g., “Your actions have saved X trees”), making sustainability efforts more relatable and motivating.\nCommunity Dashboard. The app aggregates carbon footprint data for users’ affiliations, such as academic institutions or geographic locations to provide a collective view of users’ community impact.\n\n\n\n\nMockups\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nWeb Application Prototype\nBusiness Proposal\n\n\n\nAbout the Contest\nSynergy 2024: Software Solutions is hosted by the UP Engineering Radio Guild, a software-develoopment hackathon designed to utilize engineering minds in creating solutions to modern problems that bring forth societal impacts. For this year, Software Solutions strives towards sustainable development by challenging participants to influence responsible production and consumption of resources through technology and innovation."

Our project bested more than 100 teams in a three-month period and finished in 10th place.\n\n\nKey Features\nAfter statistically validating our results via hypothesis testing, we applied the results in multiple ways such as creating personalized marketing messages using ChatGPT and using time-series forecasting techniques for the clusters’ behavior. K-Means was chosen to be the final model due to its high silhouette score and a clear visual clustering using t-SNE (dimensionality reduction).\n\n\n\nSummary of Clustering Results\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\nData Cleaning: Aggregating various financial datasets provided and performing necessary cleaning to prepare the data for analysis.\nExploratory Data Analysis: Conduct an initial analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the data.\nCustomer Segmentation Optimization: Tested various clustering techniques including:\n\nK-Means\nK-Medoids\nK-Prototypes\nHDBSCAN\nGaussian Mixture\n\nIntelligent Application:\n\nUsed the Kruskal-Wallis test to determine statistically significant differences among clusters.\nUsed ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to generate hyper-targeted advertisements for each customer segment.\nUsed Prophet, a time series forecasting algorithm to predict transaction volumes for each cluster.\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nProject Banner\n\n\n\nAbout the Contest\nHosted by the UP Data Science Society in partnership with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), PJDSC is an annual, nationwide data science competition for undergraduate students and young professionals. For this year, participants were challenged to develop data science solutions for financial inclusivity."
